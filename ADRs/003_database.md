# Choice of database
# Status: pending
# Context
A database may be required to store partner information. However, such
information may be more easily stored and manipulated through SalesForce.
# Decision
If a database is necessary, then we will use either MySQL or MariaDB.
# Result
We must wait to see if a database is absolutely crucial, but one may 
be implemented anyway simply so that any required configuration 
is already taken care of. These databases are easy to use and should
be able to meet any specifications required for this project.
